# SF Hacks 2017 / Webcam Music

This was a project done in a 24-hour hackathon.  

The app is created in Processing and uses your webcam to create music.  

It takes several pictures, analyzes the colors of each picture, then plays musical notes based on the colors in the order of the pictures taken.
